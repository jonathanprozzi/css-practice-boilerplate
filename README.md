# Project Overview

This is a boilerplate setup for practice CSS projects. Implements the structure I've
been using (sass + gulp).

## Usage

Clone the repo and use it to provide basic structure. Add in appropriate classes and CSS frameworks as needed for practice.

The idea is to save some time when creating basic landing pages for practicing different frameworks.
